As a Technical Writer, you communicate with members of other departments such as regulatory, engineers, developers, designers, SMEs and project managers.

This article will give you some advices how to deal with an unresponsive SME in the daily work of a Technical Writer. However, you can use the tips below to collaborate with other team members.

### Who are SMEs?
Subject Matter Experts are **specialists in their field**. SMEs can be for example: engineers, developers, service technicians or UX designers. They have a huge **technical knowledge** in a subject (such as product, process, technology).

Basically, Technical Writers are translators, who translate SMEsâ€™ technical terminology into clear and understandable language to most users.
  
Keep in mind, Subject Matter Experts are usually busy. They work on creating new solutions to technical problems, have many meetings and do not have hours to explan to Technical Writers "how exactly it works".

### Meet your SME

Integrate with your SME to create effective cooperation.  
Find **common ground** for both of you - it could be hobbies, favorite pets, hometown etc. Small talks can also be helpful in breaking the ice before the start of each meeting.

Getting to know your SME will give you insight into which **way of communication** is the most comfortable for your coworker.

### Prepare the rules of cooperation

The stereotypical Subject Matter Expert is an introverted person, who loves working independently. 

**But who are you working with?**  
Check if SME, with which you will be collaborating, prefer to have all the information in black on white (via e-mail or chat), or maybe they would appreciate direct interaction during meetings.

### Respect SME's time

When you planning a meeting with your SME, **be prepared** for it. 

- [x] **Perform research** of available information about the product, that you will be working on together.
- [x] **Prepare a meeting agenda** in which you describe the points that you want to discuss. This will also help your SME prepare appropriately for the meeting.
- [x] **Ask the right questions.** Maybe after doing product research you can suggest some ideas for improvement?

This conversation should be an open discussion, but one that you come back with clearly defined actions to do.
